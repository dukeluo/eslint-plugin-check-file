# The folder should follow the folder naming convention (folder-naming-convention)

Allows you to enforce a consistent naming pattern for the name of the specified folder.

## Rule Details

This rule aims to format the name of the specified folder. This rule uses the glob match syntax to match target folders and declare the naming pattern for the folder name.

There are six basic naming conventions built into this rule, including `CAMEL_CASE`, `PASCAL_CASE`, `SNAKE_CASE`, `KEBAB_CASE`, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` and `FLAT_CASE`.

**Additionally, there is a naming convention called `NEXT_JS_APP_ROUTER_CASE` used to format folder names in Next.js projects that used App Router.** `NEXT_JS_APP_ROUTER_CASE` aims to support a wide range of named constructs in Next.js App Router projects, including Standard routes, Dynamic segments, Catch-all segments, Optional Catch-all Segments, Route groups, and Named slots.

While `NEXT_JS_APP_ROUTER_CASE` covers many naming cases, it's possible that some cases may be missing. If you come across any missing cases, I encourage you to open an issue and provide the necessary details. Your feedback will help me improve and enhance the naming convention.

| Formatting  | Name                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| helloWorld  | `CAMEL_CASE`           |
| HelloWorld  | `PASCAL_CASE`          |
| hello_world | `SNAKE_CASE`           |
| hello-world | `KEBAB_CASE`           |
| HELLO_WORLD | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` |
| helloworld  | `FLAT_CASE`            |

If the rule had been set as follows:

```js
...
'check-file/folder-naming-convention': ['error', { 'src/**/': 'CAMEL_CASE' }],
...
```

Examples of **incorrect** folder name for this rule:

```sh
src/Components/DisplayLabel/displayLabel.js
src/components/DisplayLabel/displayLabel.js
src/components/displayLabel/DisplayLabel.js
```

Examples of **correct** folder name for this rule:

```sh
src/components/displayLabel/displayLabel.js
```

## Custom patterns

In addition to the built-in naming conventions, you can also set custom naming patterns using glob match syntax. The following code shows an example of how to ensure that all the folders under the `components` folder are named begin with `__`:

```js
...
'check-file/folder-naming-convention': ['error', [{ 'components/*/': '__+([a-z])' }]],
...
```

**Tip:** To exclude `__tests__` folder in `src`, use the glob expression `src/!(__tests__)/**/` to get the target folders.

### Next.js example

If you would like to enforce a kebab-case naming convention for your folders, but also
support Next.js' catch-all routes, dynamic segments, etc. that use square brackets, you could achieve that with a pattern such as this:

```js
...
'check-file/folder-naming-convention': [
  'error',
  {
    'src/**/': '@(+([a-z])*(-+([a-z]))|\\[+([a-z])*(-+([a-z]))\\])',
  },
],
...
```

Note: If you don't use the `src` folder, then change the pattern to `'app/**/'` or `'pages/**/'`, according to your setup.

### Options

#### naming pattern object

The key is used to select target folders, while the value is used to declare the naming pattern for the folder name. You can specify a different naming pattern for different target folders. The plugin will only check folders you explicitly provided:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['check-file'],
  rules: {
    'check-file/folder-naming-convention': [
      'error',
      {
        'src/**/': 'CAMEL_CASE',
        'mocks/*/': 'KEBAB_CASE',
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
